在自然语言处理领域里，情感分析已经被广泛应用，一般划分为以下几个部分:文本的预处理、文本特征的提取、机器学习分类器训练等方面。随着深层神经网络模型在图像识别，机器翻译等领域内的巨大进展，深层神经网络模型被证明在文本特征向量提取方面有着巨大的优势。

本文的研究内容是循环神经网络在情感分析领域对电影评论的研究。主要结合时下性能较好的循环神经网络方法，进行分析比较并结合。本文要基于word2vec使用模型,采用了Word Embedding机制训练包含语义特征的词向量，避免了高维度输入易产生维度灾难的问题。同时，基于Word Embedding训练出的词向量具有相似度的特征，具备了一定的语义信息，作为Attention-Based IndRNN模型的输入，对二值分类器的性能具有一定的提高效果。

在文本特征提取问题上，基于时下较为优异的模型，本文设计了Attention-Based IndRNN和Attention-Based Bi-IndRNN模型，其中IndRNN相对传统RNN和LSTM来说，解决了梯度消失和梯度爆炸的问题。同时本文通过Attention-Based的方法，得到含有输入序列注意力概率分布的语义编码，并将其作为二值分类器的输入，减少了特征向量提取过程中的信息丢失和信息冗余，可以有效地突出关键词的作用。该方法可以得到包含注意力概率分布的语义特征，并对特征提取部分进行优化。基于豆瓣影评及IMDB影评数据集进行测评，结果表明:这两个模型在多个情感分析任务中都取得了相对较好的效果。

% ABSTRACT
\def\abstracten{
In the field of natural language processing, sentiment analysis has been widely used and is generally divided into the following sections: text preprocessing, text feature extraction, machine learning classifier training and so on. As deep learning technology has made great progress in image recognition, machine translation and other fields, the deep learning model has been proved to have great advantages in data preprocessing and feature extraction.

The research content of this paper is the research of film review in the field of sentiment analysis by cyclic neural network. Mainly combined with the current method of better performance of the circulatory neural network, analysis and comparison. This article is based on the word2vec use model, using the Word Embedding mechanism to train the word vectors containing semantic features, to avoid the problem of dimensional disaster caused by high-dimensional input. At the same time, the word vectors trained based on Word Embedding have similarity features and possess certain semantic information as input to the Attention-Based IndRNN model, and the performance of the binary classifier.

On the issue of text feature extraction, based on the current excellent model, this paper designs Attention-Based IndRNN and Attention-Based Bi-IndRNN models. IndRNN solves the problem of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion compared to traditional RNN and LSTM. At the same time, this paper adopts Attention-Based method to obtain the semantic code containing the attention probability distribution of the input sequence, and uses it as the input of the binary classifier to reduce the information loss and information redundancy in the feature vector extraction process, which can effectively Highlight the role of keywords. This method can get the semantic features containing attention probability distribution, and optimize the feature extraction part. Based on the evaluation of Douban film criticism and IMDB film review dataset, the results show that these two models have achieved relatively good results in multiple sentiment analysis tasks.
